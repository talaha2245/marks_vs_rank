Project Overview:

Objective: Predict ranks based on marks in the TS EAMCET exam using machine learning models.
Data Collection: Gathered data from YouTube channels, Google, and friends regarding marks vs. ranks for the year 2023.
Initial Analysis: Plotted a graph between marks and ranks to visualize the relationship and identify the most suitable machine learning models.

Models Considered:
1)Linear Regression
2)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3)Decision Tree
4)Random Forest

Findings:
Linear Regression and SVM: Both models did not perform well, likely due to the non-linear relationship between marks and ranks.
Decision Tree and Random Forest: These models were more promising based on their performance.

Methodology
1)Data Preparation: Compiled a dataset with marks and corresponding ranks.
2)Model Training: Applied various machine learning models to predict ranks.
3)Model Evaluation: Used accuracy measures and plotted graphs between predicted values and actual values (y_test) to 4)evaluate model performance

Model Selection:
**Based on the plotted graphs and accuracy measures, the Random Forest model was chosen due to its superior performance in handling the dataset's complexity.
